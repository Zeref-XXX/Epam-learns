By the end of this module, you will be able to:
Understand what TypeScript is, why it is used, and how it enhances JavaScript development. 
Set up a TypeScript development environment and configure tsconfig.json for project compilation. 
Declare and use basic types (string, number, boolean, etc.) and complex types (arrays, tuples, enums). 
Differentiate between type aliases and interfaces, and know when to use each. 
Apply access modifiers (public, private, protected) and understand their impact on class design. 
Work with functions in TypeScript, including optional and default parameters, return types, and function overloading. 
Implement classes, constructors, and inheritance with strong typing. 
Use generics to write reusable and type-safe functions, classes, and interfaces. 
Handle union and intersection types, and apply type guards for safe type checking. 
Understand and apply decorators, modules, and namespaces for scalable application development. 
Compile TypeScript into JavaScript and debug common issues during the build process.
